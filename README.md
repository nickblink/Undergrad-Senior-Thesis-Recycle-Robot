# Undergrad-Senior-Thesis-Recycle-Robot
This contains the main files used in my Computational and Applied Math senior thesis at Rice. We were concerned with creating the optimal path for a robotic arm to pick up an object on a moving conveyor belt and how to optimally choose which objects to pick up with multiple objects on the conveyor belt. We created a simulation of our solution picking up moving objects. All our code is in MATLAB.

-MinTimeControlOptimization: Computes the path for the minimum time from a static point A to a static point B.
-normalizeangle: normalizes angle to first quadrant
-octoprisms: creates octogons for simulated grabbing
-RoboPresentation: A presentation of our project halfway through
-robot_draw: Draws the Scara robot arm
-ScaraFK: computes torque of robot arm
-ScarInit (code written by someone else): Initializes robot arm position
-simulateScara: runs the simulation of the robot arm picking up multiple objects
-testsimulateSCARA: a test run simulating the scara arm
